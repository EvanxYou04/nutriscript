🖼️ Patient Dashboard UI – Design Brief
Goal:
Create a clean, accessible, and mobile-friendly dashboard that shows a patient their personalized dietary recommendations, based on what their doctor submitted.

🧩 Layout Overview
🔷 1. Header / Welcome Section
Title: “Your Personalized Nutrition Plan”

Optional subtitle: “These recommendations were prepared for you by your healthcare provider.”

🍽️ 2. Diet Overview Card
A prominent card summarizing the overall plan.

Example text:

“Low-sodium, Mediterranean-style diet with high fiber. Focus on mostly plant-based meals.”

Could use pill-style tags like:

low-sodium, high fiber, plant-based, heart healthy

✅ 3. Recommended Foods List
A visual list of preferred foods:

Each item could be inside a rounded card with:

✅ Food name (e.g. “Lentils”)

🥗 Emoji or icon

(Optional) brief reason like “High fiber”

Consider a grid or scrollable horizontal cards

🚫 4. Foods to Avoid
A section clearly showing excluded foods

Maybe styled in red or faded out cards

Example: “Processed snacks”, “Salt-heavy condiments”

📌 5. Tags / Labels
Chips or tags summarizing the diet plan

Ex: diabetic friendly, low sugar, DASH diet, vegetarian

Use consistent colors/icons to make scanning easier

🧑‍🍳 6. Recipe Links (Optional)
If we have URLs or recipe suggestions, show them as clickable cards or buttons:

🍛 “Quinoa and lentil salad” → [View Recipe]

🛒 Option: link to a grocery list or downloadable PDF

🎨 Visual Style Guidelines
Use clear typography and large text for accessibility

Stick to soft greens, neutrals, and blues for a calming, health-focused aesthetic

Ensure mobile-first layout — many patients will view this on their phones

Use icons/emojis to help users associate food types visually (e.g. 🥦, 🐟, 🍚)

🧠 Accessibility & Simplicity
Use alt text or labels for all icons

Prioritize readability: plain language over medical terms

Avoid overwhelming users — group info into clear, scrollable sections

🔁 Data You’ll Receive from the Backend
Here’s a sample JSON the dashboard will receive:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "diet_type": "low-sodium, Mediterranean",
  "excluded_foods": ["processed snacks", "red meat"],
  "preferred_foods": ["quinoa", "lentils", "olive oil", "spinach"],
  "tags": ["heart healthy", "plant-based", "high fiber"]
}
Use this structure to mock your UI components.
